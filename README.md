## Features

- Create a REST API out of a [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) compatible JSON-File
- Swagger UI integrated (Swagger spec automatically generated)
- GrapqhiQL integrated (Graphql schema automatically generated)
- Additional JSON File validations at startup
- Readonly or Read/Write Mode (file stored in S3 Bucket)
- Deployment in AWS:
  - Own CLI to test locally and immediately deploy it to the cloud
  - Deployed in AWS cloud within Minutes by a single command
  - Almost **zero costs** (First million requests for Lambda are free)
  - Less maintenance as the deployed solution runs **serverless**
- Security:
  - Secured with https by default.
  - Optional: Use a generated API Key
- Customization:
  - This solution written in **Typescript** can be easily extended for additional enhanced scenarios
    - adding user authentication
    - own custom domain
    - additional routes etc.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Solution

```bash
npm i -g json-serverless
```

### 2. Run local

1. create a jsonserver-file sample e.g. db.json

   ```
   {
       "posts": [
         { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" },
         { "id": 2, "title": "test", "author": "yourAuthor" }
       ],
       "comments": [
         { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
       ],
       "profile": { "name": "typicode" }
   }
   ```

2) execute command

   ```
   jsonsls run db.json
   ```

### 3. Deploy api to AWS

1. Verify that you have a AWS account and set appropriate credentials
2. execute command

   ```bash
   jsonsls create-stack db.json {optional: STAGE}
   ```

- a stack template folder will be created that contains the deployable serverless framework solution.
  <b>You can use the serverless cli in this stack template folder.</b>

* When the deployment was successful you can see following output

  <pre>
  <code>
  Service Information
  service: serverless-json-server
  stage: dev
  region: eu-central-1
  stack: serverless-json-server-dev
  api keys:
    serverless-json-server.dev: <b>{API-KEY}</b>
  endpoints:
    ANY - <b>https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ <== {ENDPOINTURL}</b>
    ANY - https://xxxxxxx.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/{proxy+}
  functions:
    app: serverless-json-server-dev-app
  layers:
    None
  Serverless: Removing old service artifacts from S3...
  </pre></code>

### 4. Test your Api

Open the {ENDPOINTURL}: https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ that you received as output

| Features              | Relative Path | Sample with Endpoint                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swagger UI            | /ui           | https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ui        |
| Swagger Specification | /api-spec     | https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api-spec  |
| GraphiQL              | /graphql      | https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/graphql   |
| API Routes            | /api/{routes} | https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/posts |

**MIND**: If you have set enableApiKeyAuth to true => [SwaggerUI](#Cannot-use-Swagger-UI-when-enableApiKeyAuth-is-true)
)

#### With Curl

1. replace the url with the url provided by serverless (see above)
2. replace the {API-KEY} with the key you get from serverless (see above)
3. replace {route} at the end of the url e.g. with posts (default value)

Default Schema:

```bash
Default route is posts: (see db.json)
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/posts

# or another route given in db.json file
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/{route}

# with enableApiKeyAuth=true
curl -H "x-api-key: {API-KEY}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/{route}

```

What`s my {route} ? -> see [json-server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Customization

### Update content of db.json

1. update local db.json file in root directory with new values
2. re-deploy the stack via serverless framework

   ```bash
    jsonsls update-stack
   ```

3. delete db.json file in S3 Bucket
4. Make a GET request against the root url https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api

# with enableApiKeyAuth=true
curl -H "x-api-key: {API-KEY}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://xxxxxx.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/{route}


```

=> With the next request a new db.json file will be created in the S3 Bucket

#### Adapt settings

| enableApiKeyAuth     | Make your routes private by using an additional ApiKey                   | boolean | false   |

## Further Development

the json file will be loaded directly from your local filesystem. No AWS access is needed.

### Start solution

```bash
make start-test
```

### Test your API

#### With Swagger

Open the {ENDPOINTURL}: http://localhost:3000/ui that you received as output

#### With Curl

1. replace the url with the url provided by serverless (see above)
2. replace the {API - KEY} with the key you get from serverless (see above)
3. replace {route} at the end of the url e.g. with posts (default value)

Default Schema:

```bash
Default route is posts: (see db.json)
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/posts

#or another route given in db.json file
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/{route}
```

## FAQ

### Cannot use Swagger UI when enableApiKeyAuth is true

The apiKey is set in AWS API Gateway. This means all requests (even the standard route) need to use the API-KEY.

If you want to see the Swagger UI you need to add a plugin e.g. ModHeader to Chrome and add the needed headers:

- Content-Type: application/json
- x-api-key: {provided by sls info in the output after deployment}

![ModHeader](docs/header.png)

### I forgot the API-KEY I have set

Ensure you have credentials for AWS set.

```bash
sls info
```

### Destroy the stack in the cloud

```bash
sls remove
```

### I deployed the solution but I get back a http 500 error

Check Cloudwatch Logs in AWS - the issue should be describe there. Log has the same name as the stack that has been created.
